How to split a node app - a presentation given at a DevMountain Climb Night, Aug 23, 2017

## Introduction
When you learn Node and how to set up servers with Express (or even vanilla Node), many examples you see show all of the functionality of the server stuffed into one file, or they show ways to split it up which aren't very scaleable or difficult to reason with.  This repo is a sample repo which holds an example of how to split up your Node server into smaller, more manageable pieces.

As the repo description explains, this repo is an example used as part of a presentation given at a [DevMountain](https://devmountain.com/) Climb Night, and the rough footage is available [here](https://youtu.be/-32idTiqUiA).  The solution from the presentation is found on the solution branch, and any subsequent presentations' solutions can be found under `solution-<identifier>`.

If you have come to practice with this simple example, feel free to fork and clone this repository so you can try it out on your own machine.  This README is a work-in-progress, so please consult the solution branches for places where the README is lacking.  I promise to update the README with full instructions and explanations, and if there is something missing, further clarification is needed, or for general questions, check the issues in the [main repo](https://github.com/cwadrupldijjit/splitting-a-node-app) to see if someone has already asked it, or if you can't find it, please open an issue so that a conversation can be started amongst me and others in the community.
